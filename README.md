# Portfolio Hub
This repository is a point-of-contact with projects created by Jonathan Cales. The nature of these projects are recreational or academic as a skills showcase to employers. Due to this, there is no license used to invite contributors - this is intentional. Please review default copyright laws if you are unfamiliar with what softward and code without a license means as to avoid any take-downs or conflicting/unwanted changes to this repository.

At a later date, a website will be created to be a better portfolio showcase, and this repository will may be archived. This repository may be temporary.
